CHAT APPLICATION

Our chat application is based on Socket Programming.
Here we have, one client and one server.
Chatting takes place between server and client and vice - versa.
The messages are sent alternately between the Client and Server.
File Transfer is also possible but only from Server to Client. File transfer includes all kinds of files such as .txt, .mp3, .mp4, .jpeg, .pdf etc.
This transfer just needs the two devices to be connected to the same network (wired or wireless).

The program needs Jdk 7 Development Kit to be downloaded on the systems that wish to chat/transfer files.
Instructions to execute the program :
Keep Server and Client source code files and .class in the folder on both machines that wish to communicate.
Start the Server Application and then on the other machine start the Client application.
The system is now ready for transferring messages by client and server alternately.
To terminate a chat any one of the Server or the Client has to type : Bye.
Sending a file:
If a file is to be sent either the Server or the client has to type FILE .
The Server must have the file located in the same folder as the .class of the Server is present.
Then the server enters the name of the file.
The client then types in the name with which he/she wants the file to be saved in the system.
The normal chat can then continue from that point onwards
